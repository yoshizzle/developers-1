            The Linode API will return JSON objects to describe the various kinds of
            objects you can manage with it. These objects will always include an ID in
            the form of <code>prefix_####</code>. The prefix is a 4 character prefix
            that identifies the type of record you're dealing with, and #### is a unique
            integer ID.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the objects the API returns have relationships to other objects. For
            convenience, we will often return a shorter version of the related object's
            record with a few properties included, and the ID. You can always do another
            request to get the full record for any related objects if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, you may submit objects you receive through GET requests
            to the same endpoint you received them from, with a PUT request, to edit
            details of that object. Not all properties are editable, see the reference
            for each object type for a list of editable properties.
