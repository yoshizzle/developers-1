            This documentation is for <strong>version 2</strong> of the Linode API. For <strong>version 1</strong> go
            <a href="https://www.linode.com/api/">here</a>.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        The Linode API is an HTTP service that follows (to a large extent)
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>
        style. Resources (like Linodes) have predictable, sane URLs that use standard
        HTTP methods to manipulate and return standard HTTP status codes to tell you how
        it went.
        </p>
        <p>
        All API endpoints (starting from version 2) are located at
        <code>https://{{ site.api_root }}/{{ site.api_version }}/*</code>. Occasionally we will add
        features and improvements to our API - only certain changes will trigger a
        version bump:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Endpoint path changes</li>
            <li>JSON properties removed or changed</li>
            <li>Core changes (authentication, RESTful principles, etc)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Notably, the addition of new API endpoints and new properties on JSON blobs does
        not imply a new version number.

        The API exposes <strong>resources</strong> through various HTTP endpoints.
        You work with these resources through consistent use of HTTP verbs and
        a consistent tree of endpoints. The schema for the various resources
        available is documented in the <a href="#objects">objects</a> section.
        </p>
        <h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>
        <p>
        To use some API endpoints authentication is required. This is indicated by the
        <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Authenticated</span> notation
        throughout the documentation. We use the basic OAuth workflow were you can create
        <em>applications</em> that integrate with Linode by registering those applications with us.
        You then use OAuth to authenticate on behalf of the user to request access to resources from their account.
        </p>
        <p>
        To register your application go to
        <a target="_blank" href="https://{{ site.login_root }}/apps">{{ site.login_root }}/apps</a>.
        We'll provide you with a <em>client ID</em> and a <em>client secret</em>.
        You'll have to keep the client secret private, but the client ID can be shared.
        </p>
        <h5>The Access Code</h5>
        <p>
        In the OAuth workflow it is a two step process to authenticate a user before you can start making API calls.
        You will first need to request an <strong>access code</strong> that can then be exchanged for an
        <strong>authorization token</strong>. To aid as many application developers as possible with their
        design we provide two methods for requesting an access code.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row reference">
    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify left">
        <h5>Through The Web</h5>
        <p>
        If you are making a web based application this is the recommended method for getting a user's authorization.
        When you want a user to log into your service, you can direct them to a URL similar to this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>https://{{ site.login_root }}/oauth/authorize?client_id=<strong>client_id</strong></code></pre>
        <p>
        The user logs in to Linode and is presented the scope levels your application is requesting.
        Once the user accepts your request for access, we redirect them back to you with an <em>access code</em>.
        You may then exchange the access code for an <em>authorization token</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are additional parameters that you can supply in the query string of the above request.
        If you provided a redirect_uri when you sent the user to {{ site.login_root }},
        they will be redirected to that URI. Otherwise, the default redirect URI associated with your
        OAuth client application will be used.
        </p>
        <p>
        When the user is redirected, several parameters will be added to the query string:
        <code>code</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>email</code>, and <code>state</code>.
        The last parameter will match the state you gave us at the start of the flow. This allows you to ensure
        that the OAuth flow was initiated by your application, rather than by someone manually navigating to
        {{ site.login_root }} with your <code>client_id</code>. The username and email are just for convenience.
        The important parameter is the code, this is the <em>access code</em> you need to continue the OAuth flow.
        </p>
        <h5>Direct Access Request</h5>
        <p>
        If you are writing a command line application or something similar that does not allow for easy
        access to a web browser and handling a redirect, we provide a direct authorization workflow.
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
            <p>
            You should not use this workflow for web based applications. This method is for the convenience of the
            developer, but it limits the visibility the user has into the scopes you have requested. This is because
            using this workflow bypasses the user consent page. This workflow also requires that the user gives your
            application access to their password instead of only allowing Linode to know their password. For these reasons
            you should take extra care when using this workflow.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
        In this workflow you make the following request:
        </p>
        <pre><code>POST https://{{ site.login_root }}/oauth/authorize/direct</code></pre>
        <p>
        Make this request as <code>application/json</code> and include the following parameters in the POST body:
        </p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal row">
            <dt class="col-sm-2">client_id</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Your application's client ID</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">scopes</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">The resources you want access to</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">username</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">The user's name for Linode</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">password</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">The user's password for Linode</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
        You will be given an <em>access code</em> that can be exchanged for an <em>authorization token</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once you have an access code using either of the above workflows, you will then exchange that <em>access code</em> for
        an <em>authorization token</em>. The token is what you will use to authenticate API requests on behalf of that user.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6 right">
        <p>You can include the following parameters in the query string when
        you direct your users to {{ site.login_root }}:</p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parameter</th>

                    <td>Where to redirect the user after login. If provided,
                        the redirect URI you registered your application
                        with should match the start of this string. If you
                        registered your app with http://example.org as the redirect
                        URI, then this parameter must start with "http://example.org".</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>state</td>

    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify left">
        <h5>Access Token</h5>
        <p>
        Once the user has logged in to Linode and you have received an <em>access code</em>, you 
        will need to exchange that access code for an <em>Authorization token</em>. You do this by
        making the following HTTP request:
        </p>
        <pre><code>POST https://{{ site.login_root }}/oauth/token</code></pre>
        <p>
        Make this request as <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> or
        as <code>multipart/form-data</code> and include the following paramters
        in the POST body:
        </p>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal row">
            <dt class="col-sm-2">client_id</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Your app's client ID</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">client_secret</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Your app's client secret</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-2">code</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">The code you just received from the redirect</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
        You'll get a response like this:
        </p>
<pre><code>
{
  "scopes": "linodes:create",
  "access_token": "03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c"
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
        Note that we include the scopes here, in the future, we may change the
        login flow to allow the user to deny access to specific scopes. You
        should consider this list of scopes returned in the response as the final
        level granted as it may be different than the ones you asked for. Also
        included is the actual <code>access_token</code>. With this token, you
        can proceed to make authenciated HTTP requests with the API by adding
        this header to each request:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Authorization: token 03d084436a6c91fbafd5c4b20c82e5056a2e9ce1635920c30dc8d81dc7a6665c</code></pre>

<div class="row reference">
    <div class="col-md-6 text-justify left">
        <h5>OAuth Scopes</h5>
        <p>
        The above login flow will give you the minimum amount of access to a user's account.
        That is, you are only allowed to see their username and email address. If you
        want more access, you need to add <em>OAuth scopes</em> to the query string.
        An OAuth scope defines the level of access your OAuth token will receive.
        You can request a comma-delimited list of scopes by adding <code>scopes=a,b,c</code>
        to the query string of the <code>{{ site.login_root }}</code> URL.
        </p>
        <p>
        A scope takes the form of <code>resource:access</code>, where the
        <strong>access</strong> to that particular <strong>resource</strong> is limited
        by the level the user grants to your application.
        </p>
        <p>
        You may request the following levels of access for any given resource:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>view</strong> - <em>lowest level</em></li>
            <li><strong>modify</strong></li>
            <li><strong>create</strong></li>
            <li><strong>delete</strong> - <em>highest level</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        In addition to the level of access you request,
        you will be granted each access level below it. For example, requesting
        <em>modify</em> access will also grant you <em>view</em> access, and requesting <em>delete</em>
        access will grant you <em>full</em> access to that resource (<code>resource:*</code>
        has the same effect).
        </p>
        <p>
        Each API endpoint documented on this page includes the OAuth scope necessary
        to use that resource. It will look like this:
        <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-key"></i> linodes:view</span>.
        You may also request <code>*</code> to get full access to a user's account,
        but this is highly discouraged. You should do your best to request the least amount
        of access needed for your application to function.

        <h4 id="lists-and-objects">Lists &amp; Objects</h4>
        <p>
        There are generally two kinds of resources you can retrieve with a GET
        request: objects and lists. An object is a representation of an individual resource.
        It has an ID that can be used to retrieve it directly. A list is a collection of objects.
        You'll generally find lists of objects at <code>/:type</code>, and an individual object
        at <code>/:type/:id</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        Some objects contain lists of other objects, which you can get at <code>/:type/:id/:subtype</code>.
        You can get an individual sub-object at <code>/:type/:id/:subtype/:id</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
        For example, you can list your Linodes at <code>/linodes</code>, and get
        a specific Linode with <code>/linodes/lnde_1234</code>. You can get the configs
        for this Linode from <code>/linodes/lnde_1234/configs</code>.
        </p>
        <h4 id="pagination">Pagination</h4>
        <p>
        Resource lists are always paginated. The response will look similar to this:
        </p>
<pre><code>
{
    "linodes": [ ... ],
    "page": 1,
    "total_pages": 10,
    "total_results": 248
}
</code></pre>
        <p>Pages start at 1. You may get a particular page by adding <code>?page=2</code>
        to your URL. Each page has at most 25 results.</p>
        <h4 id="editing-objects">Editing Objects</h4>
        <p>
        Some resource objects may be modified, however, these objects contain both
        mutable and immutable properties. The properties that are mutable in an object
        are indicated in the <a href="#objects">objects reference section</a>, with this
        indicator: <span class="text-muted"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Editable</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
        To edit these objects, you can perform a <code>PUT</code> request against
        the resource whose body is the updated JSON. You can omit any of the fields or
        include fields you are not permitted to edit, however, changes to the latter will
        be ignored.
        This makes it simple for you to <code>GET</code> a resource, change a property in
        the JSON that is returned, and then <code>PUT</code> that JSON back to the same URL
        to update the object.

        <p>
            Success is indicated via
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">
                standard HTTP status codes
            </a>. Generally speaking, <code>2xx</code> codes indicate success,
            <code>4xx</code> codes indicate an error on your side, and
            <code>5xx</code> codes indicate an error on our side. An error on your
            side might be an invalid input, a required parameter being omitted, and
            so on. Errors on our side are not going to happen often and we're
            probably going to be running around with our hair on fire if you ever
            see them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every request that returns errors will look something like this:
        </p>
<pre><code>
{
    "success": false,
    "errors": [
        {
            "field": "datacenter",
            "reason": "Record not found"
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
        <p>
            The <code>success</code> field may not appear in requests that did
            not result in an error. The <code>errors</code> field is an array of
            the things that went wrong with your request. We will try to include
            as many of the problems in the response as possible, but it's
            possible that fixing these errors and resubmitting may result in new
            errors coming back once we are able to get further along in the
            process of handling your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within each error object, the <code>field</code> parameter will be
            included if the error pertrains to a specific field in the JSON
            you've submitted. This will be omitted if there is no relevant
            field. The <code>reason</code> is a human-readable reason for the
            error, and will always be included.
